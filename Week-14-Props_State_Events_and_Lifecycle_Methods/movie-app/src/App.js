// Using what you've learned this week, create a page of an application 
// that enables users to vote and leave reviews on movies.
// All data necessary for this assignment, including Movies and Reviews, 
// can be pulled from an API or you can create the Movies and their Reviews yourself.
// Your application must include the following components:
// -MovieList: a container for all the Movie components and their data.
// -Movie: a component that represents movie data (i.e. image, synopsis, rating, etcâ€¦)
// -Stars: a one to five-star rating component that allows users to rate something 
// (movies in this case, but remember that components are reusable, so you could use it elsewhere!)
// ReviewList: a container inside of a Movie that houses Review components.
// Review: A text review a user can leave on a movie.
// ReviewForm: a form at the bottom of a Movie component that allows users to leave reviews. 
// When submitted, the review should be added to the movie. 
// All this data can be stored in an array, no networking or database needed for this assignment.


// **  My plan is to make a site of some of my favorite Nicolas Cage movies:  
//      Willie's Wonderland
//      The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent
//      Pig
//      Renfield
//      Grand Isle
//      Adaptation.
//      Face/off
//      

// bare bones minimum Components, return jsx. have a couple of those with the returns
// dummy data
