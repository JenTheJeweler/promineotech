  <p class="text-center ">Rocco is a dog of extrodinary talents. He is cute, always sniffing around and loves to play games.  
    His favorite game is Tug of war. Rocco was found in a San Antonio Home Depot parking lot. Abandoned but undaunted, he went
    up to a human who gave him water and then never left her side. That was 8 years ago, and veterinarians guessed that he 
    was anywhere form 1-3 years old when he was found that day. 
     He communicates that he wants a treat by smacking his lips while sticking his toungue out a little bit. 
     He does not chase after balls unless he is inside on a rainy day because he is just more sophisticated than one who would mindlessly run after a ball over and over.
    He prefers to look for live animals to focus his prey drive on (although he is never allowed to act on these impulses.)  Rocco is just as selective about his
    canine friends as he is about his curricular activities. He in fact prefers the company of people over other dogs, as he typically wants to be the Prince 
    of whatever social interaction he engages in, and most other dogs do not understand this heirarchy. Rocco loves (mostly) all people and especially children. 
    He is most likely a descendant of some distant past king and lives his life accordingly.</p>
